            <h1>How to quickly travel to the stars without defying the laws of physics</h1>
            <blockquote>tl;dr Digitalized, pausable humans crewing a self-repairing star ship travelling at a space shuttle's
                speed can visit thousands of stars within a lifetime.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <dl>
                <dt>Human consciousness can be digitalized</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>with robot avatars. ðŸ¤– Alternatively nanobots can preserve and repair the body forever and are able to instantly pause and unpause the mind.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>Self-repairing star ships remain functional for thousands of years</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>The second ingredient is self-repairing interstellar star ships that can replenish their resources using asteroids and
                        solar energy. They would have to carry sufficient energy to remain functional (although potentially in hibernation) while travelling between solar systems.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>You live to see these star ships</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Let's - for the beauty of the idea - assume that above requirements will become possible within only one or two centuries (It's not unimaginable with today's tech).
                        The tricky part for humans living in 2020 is to stay alive to see that day. I have the hope that digitalizing consciousness becomes a possibility within the 21st century. As in the last century the fallback would be the freezer. ðŸ˜œ</p>

            <h2>Time is Relative</h2>
            <p>With today's propulsion technology it would take the star ship thousands of years.
                The star ship's speed doesn't really matter because</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It's crew sleeps/pauses during travel between stars</li>
                <li>The ship is self-repairing</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How does it feel?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The star ship is populated by a crew of said digital people.</li>
                <li>While en route the people are paused.</li>
                <li>From the crew's perspective no time passes between destinations.</li>
                <li>The crew can check out thousands of suns, planets, moons, nebula and go where no one has gone
                    before.
                </li>
                <li>The downside is that contact with earth is probably futile because earth develops (for the better or worse) while these star ships travel the galaxy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            </p>
